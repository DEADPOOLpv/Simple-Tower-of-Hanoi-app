# Tower of Hanoi Game Implementation

This code recreates the famous Tower of Hanoi puzzle game in Flutter. Players transfer discs of varied sizes between three towers to create a specified arrangement. The game maintains track of how many movements you've made.

## Key features:

- Visual Representation: The game's arrangement is vertical, with three towers represented by coloured rectangles. Discs are represented as blue rectangles with sizes proportionate to their value.
- Interactive Towers: Tapping on a tower with discs on top enables you to transfer the highest disc to another valid tower.
- Move Tracking: The number of movements made is shown at the top of the screen.
- Reset Button: The "Reset" button enables players to resume the game with the default settings.
- Responsive Layout: The game adjusts to various screen widths, maintaining accurate alignment of towers and discs.
- Flutter Framework: The code uses Flutter widgets and functions to create the user interface and manage user interactions.
